#summary The method behind the madness of version numbering.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

You've got a version number.  What's that mean?


= Overview =
Incrementing the version numbers have a pretty strict meaning on the JConch project.
  * *All Versions Pre-1.0* -- Releases were pretty willy-nilly, with a lot of experimentation going on.
  * *Major Releases* -- Tested and ready to go, with no guaranty of any backward compatibility to the previous major release series.
  * *x.9 Minor Release* -- The release candidate for the next major release.
  * *Minor Releases < x.9* -- New API may be introduced, and warning-inducing changes to the code base (incl. deprecation) may be introduced.
  * *Point Releases* -- No API changes: bugfixes only.


= Changelog =
  * *1.1* -- Added concurrent testing utilities Assert#assertSynchronized and SerialExecutorService. Updated documentation. 
  * *1.0* -- Moved pipelines over to the sandbox, and got the unit tests to where they should be.
  * *0.3* -- Implemented typing for the CacheMap, with the untyped version being relegated to ObjectCacheMap.  Also implemented the GroovyCacheMap for one-line groovytastic gold.  See more [http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/2008/03/14/jconch-03-released/ at the EnfranchisedMind post]
